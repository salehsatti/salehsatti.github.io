<h3>Completed Research</h3>	
		<h4>The Sudan Hydroeconomic Optimization Model (SHOM)</h4>	
		<span> The effects of development and the uncertainty of climate change in East Africa provide a myriad of challenges for water managers along the Blue Nile. The construction of the Grand renaissance dam (GERD), as well as the unknown trajectory of precipitation trends in the Ethiopian highlands may greatly affect the countries that rely on the Nile. Sudan’s huge irrigation potential and dams that feed multiple current irrigation schemes as well as its location within the basin means that Sudan’s water management decisions may reverberate and have social, economic and political implications within the east African sub-region. This research combines climatic, hydrologic, agronomic and economic inputs to drive an optimization model developed within the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). This Sudanese Hydroeconomic Optimization Model determines the optimal decisions under competing hydropower and irrigation tradeoffs in order to maximize the total economic benefits. Details of the model are found <a href="http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2275/2015/hess-19-2275-2015.html">here</a>.

<h3>Ongoing Research</h3>
		<h4>Improving Seasonal Forecasting</h4>	
		<p> The unpredictable nature of precipitation within the East African (EA) region makes it one of the most vulnerable, food insecure regions in the world. There is a vital need for forecasts to inform decision makers, both local and regional, and to help formulate the region’s climate change adaptation strategies. Understanding East African regional dynamics can help provide more accurate short range climate forecasts for food insecure regions EA. Use of climate regionalization can help isolate various climate phenomena that influences seasonal precipitation within the region. This research will perform an objective regionalization for seasonal forecasts in the EA region. Ultimately, results of this study will help improve the current understanding of regional drivers of precipitation within the EA region.</p>

		<h4>Using water resources optimization methods to assess value of Blue Nile Seasonal Forecasts</h4>
	<p>By using forecasted flows as upstream boundary conditions into SHOM, this research will: <br>1. Assess the theoretical value of a seasonal forecast <br>2. Evaluate the trade off between of lag time of forecast and the value of forecast for downstream decision makers. <br>3. Help highlight the difference between accurate forecasts and valuable forecasts with the Blue Nile Basin.</p>

		<h4>Empirical Downscaling and Interpolation of Tunisian Precipitation</h4>
		<p>By using machine learning algorithms, and geostatistical interpolations  spatial climate maps can be created in order to generate downscaled climate projections in areas with inadequate (and often times unreliable) climate data records.  </p>
